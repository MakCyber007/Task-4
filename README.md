# Task-5
# Firewall Configuration on Windows

## üìå Task Overview  
This project involves configuring and testing firewall rules on **Windows Defender Firewall**
### **Objective**  
- Configure inbound and outbound firewall rules to block or allow network traffic.  
- Test the firewall rule for **Telnet (Port 23)**.  
- Document configuration steps, commands used, and rule explanations.

## üîß Tools Used  
- **Windows Defender Firewall** (GUI)  
- **PowerShell Commands**  
- **Nmap** (Network Scanning)  

## üìÇ Deliverable Files  
This repository includes the following files:

1. **All_Firewall_Rules_through_PowerShell.txt**  
   - Extracted firewall rules using: `Get-NetFirewallRule > All_Firewall_Rules_through_PowerShell.txt`  

2. **Creating new firewall rule.pdf**  
   - Step-by-step documentation of rule creation using **Windows Defender Firewall (GUI)**.  

3. **PowerShell commands and Configuring Firewall rules.pdf**  
   - Screenshots of inbound and outbound firewall rules, PowerShell commands used.  
   - Documentation of additional rules created based on **Nmap scan findings**.  

4. **Testing the rule.pdf**  
   - Demonstrates the testing of **Telnet Port 23** rule by attempting a connection (`telnet localhost 23`).  

5. **README.md (This File!)**  
   - Overview of the task, tools, files, and security insights.  

## üõ°Ô∏è Firewall Rules Implemented  
The following firewall rules were created and tested:

### **Inbound Rules**
- **Block Inbound Telnet (Port 23)** ‚Äì Prevents remote Telnet access.  
- **Block Inbound MSRPC (Port 135)** ‚Äì Blocks Microsoft Remote Procedure Calls.  
- **Block Inbound NetBIOS (Port 139)** ‚Äì Disables legacy file-sharing requests.  
- **Block Inbound SMB (Port 445)** ‚Äì Prevents unauthorized access and malware risks.  

### **Outbound Rules**
- **Block Outbound HTTP (Port 80)** *(Optional)* ‚Äì Restricts unencrypted web requests for security.  

## üîç Testing Firewall Rules  
After implementing rules, we tested them using:
- **Nmap Scan** to verify blocked ports.  
- **Telnet Client** (`telnet localhost 23`) to check rule enforcement.  
 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations  
Blocking ports enhances security by:
- Reducing exposure to remote attacks.  
- Preventing unauthorized file-sharing and network access.  
- Limiting outbound connections that malware may exploit.  

### üìú Conclusion  
This project successfully demonstrates firewall rule configuration, testing, and documentation. The setup enhances network security while maintaining necessary functionalities.
